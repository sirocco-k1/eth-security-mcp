# ETH Security MCP

A collection of MCP servers for security analysts, auditors, and incident response.

### Workspaces

This repository uses npm workspaces to separate each action, to interact with a specific workspace use `npm <action> -w src/<directory-name>`

### Local Debuggings

The [MCP Inspector](https://github.com/modelcontextprotocol/inspector) can be used to locally run the servers for debugging purposes. Just make sure to build the servers locally using `npm run prepare`
